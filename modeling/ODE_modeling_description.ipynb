    "\n",
    "In the naive implementation of a circuit, we have a population of cells ($X_P$) that are producing the protein/product of interest with some rate constant $\\beta$, and as a result have some burden/growth penalty that is reflected in a growth rate $\\mu_P < \\mu_N$. Here $\\mu_P$ is the growth rate of producers, and $\\mu_N$ is the growth rate of non-producer cells. Producer cells can mutate with some probability $\\lambda_{m_B}$ (mutation that removes burden) to non-producer cells ($X_N$) that have a growth rate $\\mu_N$. Looking at this in the deterministic case in continuous culture with a carrying capacity K, and assuming the rate of production is limited in the same manner as the growth rate of the cells, we have that:\n",

    "With the addition of selection against differentiated cells through selection for the R6K plasmid, the number of cell divisions is limited. Though differentiated cells retain limited proliferative potential, they will ultimately cease dividing and die, and we will therefor refer to this as 'terminal differentiation'. With this circuit architecture, we now consider three types of mutations that may occur:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Production mutation ($\\lambda_{M_B}$): Mutation which inactivates the production capability of the cell. When a stem cell with this mutation differentiates, it will be a non-producer and growth at rate $\\mu_N$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Differentation mutation ($\\lambda_{M_D}$): Mutation which inactivates the stem cells ability to differentiate. It will then grow at rate $\\mu_N$ and be incapable of differentiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Selection mutation ($\\lambda_{M_S}$): Mutation which occurs in differentiated cells (either producers or non-producers) which allows cells to evade selection and proliferate indefinitely.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In writing out the ODEs for this case, $P$ will denote a progenitor cell capable of differentiating, $D$ will denote a differentiated cell, and $M$ will denote a mutated progenitor cell that can no longer undergo differentiation. The subscript $N$ will indicate that a stem cell will differentiate into non-productive differentiated cells, or is currently a non-productive differentiated cell, and similarly $P$ for productive. Finally, the differentiated cells are not all equal, but are distinct in the number of divisions they have remaining before diluting the plasmid through cell division to the point where antibiotic resistance is insufficient to allow further proliferation. The cell produced from the differentiation event (i=0) will have 'n' divisions remaining, and when this cell divides, there will be one fewer cell with 'n' divisions remaining, and 2 more cells with'n-1' divisions remaining (i=1). When i=n, cells will no longer divide, and this is equivalent to cell death. Though the behavior of cells that are no longer able to divide (whether or not they continue to produce the protein/product of interest) would likely depend both on the type of selectable marker encoded on the R6K plasmid and the protein/product that is being produced, using chloramphenicol resistance as the selectable marker likely would prevent protein production in cells that are no longer able to divide.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with the differentiation architecture, we make the assumption that all non-producer cells growth with the same WT growth rate. In the modeling of this architecture, we also must decide how selection will affect the growth rate of the differentiated cells. Though we could imagine cell growth slowing due to insufficient chlorR expressions as the plasmid copy number is reduced through cell division, in modeling this architecture we make the assumption that selection only affects cells with no remaining cell divisions. Therefor the growth rate of differentiated cells capable of further cell division is determined solely by the expression burden. With these assumptions, we can now write out our system of ODEs.\n",
